WordAnalysis - More TDD practice, manipulating strings and playing with data structures
============

Given a long string or set of paragraphs, perform some analysis that provides the following:

Number of each word\n
Number of each letter\n
Number of each symbol (any non-letter and non-digit character, excluding white space)
Top three most common words
Top three most common letters
Noncore: Number of words only used once
Noncore: All letters not used in the string

Use TDD to drive the design of your program.
