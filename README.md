WordAnalysis - More TDD practice, manipulating strings and playing with data structures
============

Given a long string or set of paragraphs, perform some analysis that provides the following:

Number of each word ||
Number of each letter ||
Number of each symbol (any non-letter and non-digit character, excluding white space) ||
Top three most common words ||
Top three most common letters ||
Noncore: Number of words only used once ||
Noncore: All letters not used in the string

Use TDD to drive the design of your program.
